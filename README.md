# VDJ-to-WS2812b

Simple python script to send Virtual DJ data to a python script, with the help of the Network Control extension, and transmit it over Serial to an Arduino for display.

I created this only as a proof-of-concept, however if anyone has any ideas to make it better, create an issue and I will check it out. I will test this in the wild and keep developing it.
